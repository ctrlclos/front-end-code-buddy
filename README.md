Code Buddy is an interactive coding challenge platform where users can create, share, and solve programming challenges with real-time code execution and automated test case validation.

## Background

As a developer, I wanted to build a tool that makes practicing coding problems more engaging and personalized. Unlike existing platforms, Code Buddy lets users create their own challenges with custom test cases, track their progress over time, and even leverage AI to auto-generate test cases — making it a true companion for leveling up your coding skills.

## Getting Started

- **Deployed App:** [Code Buddy](<>)
- **Planning Materials:** [Project Planning](<>)
- **Back-End Repository:** [Code Buddy Back-End](<https://github.com/ctrlclos/back-end-code-buddy>)

## Attributions

- [E2B](https://e2b.dev/) — Secure sandboxed code execution
- [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) — AI-powered test case generation
- [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) — In-browser code editor component

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End:** React 19, React Router 7, Tailwind CSS 4, CodeMirror
- **Back-End:** Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, psycopg2
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt
- **Services:** E2B (code execution sandbox), Google Gemini (AI test generation)
- **Build Tools:** Vite

## Next Steps

- Add support for multiple programming languages beyond Python/JavaScript
- Implement a public challenge marketplace for community sharing
- Add difficulty-based leaderboards and streak tracking
- Enable collaborative challenge creation between users
- Add solution explanations and hints for challenges
